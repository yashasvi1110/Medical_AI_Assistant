Dehydration: Symptoms, Causes, and Prevention

Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluids than it takes in, leading to an imbalance that can affect normal bodily functions. Understanding the signs and symptoms is crucial for maintaining good health.

What is Dehydration?

Dehydration happens when your body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to carry out its normal functions. Water makes up about 60% of your body weight and is essential for:
- Regulating body temperature
- Lubricating joints
- Protecting sensitive tissues
- Removing waste products
- Aiding in digestion

Common Causes of Dehydration:

1. Inadequate Fluid Intake:
- Not drinking enough water throughout the day
- Forgetting to drink fluids during busy activities
- Reduced thirst sensation in older adults

2. Excessive Fluid Loss:
- Vomiting and diarrhea
- Excessive sweating during exercise or hot weather
- Fever and illness
- Frequent urination due to diabetes or medications

3. Environmental Factors:
- Hot and humid weather
- High altitude
- Indoor heating or air conditioning
- Strenuous physical activity

Symptoms of Dehydration:

2. Monitor Fluid Loss:

3. Healthy Hydration Habits:

4. Special Considerations:
- Older adults should drink fluids even when not thirsty

- People with certain medical conditions may need specific guidance

When to Seek Medical Attention:

Seek immediate medical care if you experience:
- Severe diarrhea or vomiting
- Inability to keep fluids down
